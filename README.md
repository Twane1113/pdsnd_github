### Description
This is an Udacity project forming part of the Programming for Data Science for Enterprise Nanodegree Program. Using the powerful Python language, and more specifically the Pandas and Numpy features, it enables the user customized input in order to explore the data for three cities - New York City, Washington and Chicago.

### About the Files
This repository includes:
1) Three .csv files for the three cities analyzed - new_york_city.csv, washington.csv and chicago.csv
2) Python script file for exploring the data in the .csv files - Twane_PProject.py

**How to access this fun interactive project file8**
Save the Twane_PProject.py script file with the three .csv files into one folder.
Then use any suitable Python platform to interpret the code. I utlized Jupyter Notebook, which can be downloaded from [Ananconda](https://www.anaconda.com). The code script was created in Python 3, so you will need the same version. You will also need a suitable text editor and I chose Sublime Text which can be downloaded from [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com).

### Roadmap
As technology advances more in the future, we are hoping to eventually roll this project out as a live interactive website with amazing graphics and life-like user experiences.

### Credits
To complete this project, I used the understanding and knowledgebase build throughout the course Introduction to Python. When I struggled to decipher lines of code needed in the script, I referred to the excellent resources mentioned below:

1) [stackoverflow](https:/stackoverflow.com)
2) [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library)
3) [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.17.0/)
