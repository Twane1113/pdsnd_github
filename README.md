### Description
This is an Udacity project forming part of the Programming for Data Science for Enterprise Nanodegree Program. Using the powerful Python language, and more specifically the Pandas and Numpy features, it enables the user customized input in order to explore the data for three cities - New York City, Washington and Chicago.

### About the Files
This repository includes:
1) Three .csv files for the three cities analyzed - new_york_city.csv, washington.csv and chicago.csv
2) Python script file for exploring the data in the .csv files - Twane_PProject.py


### Credits
To complete this project, I used the understanding and knowledgebase build throughout the course Introduction to Python. When I struggled to decipher lines of code needed in the script, I referred to the excellent resources mentioned below:

1) [stackoverflow](https:/stackoverflow.com)
2) [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library)
3) [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.17.0/)
4) [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pandas-tutorial-dataframe-python)
5) [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/)
